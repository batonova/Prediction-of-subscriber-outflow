# Prediction-of-subscriber-outflow
### Introduction
Telecommunications companies, Internet service providers, pay-TV companies, insurance companies and alarm monitoring services often use customer analysis and customer churn indicators as one of their key business metrics, since the cost of retaining an existing customer is much less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches that try to retain customers because loyal long-term customers can bring the company much more revenue than newly recruited customers.

Companies usually distinguish between voluntary outflow and unintentional outflow. Voluntary outflow occurs due to the client's decision to switch to another company or service provider, unintentional outflow occurs due to circumstances such as relocation or death. In most cases, unintentional reasons for refusing the company's services are excluded from analytical models. Analysts tend to focus on voluntary churn, as it usually occurs due to factors in the relationship between the company and the client that companies can control, such as, for example, the cost of services or the provision of user support.

Predictive analytics uses special models that predict the outflow of customers, assessing the risk of subscriber refusal from the company's services. Since these models generate a small priority list of potential defectors, they are effective in developing marketing programs to retain customers on a subset of the customer base that are most likely to refuse services.

### Task
The task as an analyst is to predict as accurately as possible whether the subscriber will refuse the company's services for the next month.
